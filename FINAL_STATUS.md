# Final Status Report

## Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Fixed duplicate function declarations in header files
2. ✅ Fixed syntax issues in header files  
3. ✅ Added missing implementation files or fixed linking issues
4. ✅ Fixed PAGE_SIZE references in SharedMemory.cpp
5. ✅ Fixed kmalloc/kfree references throughout the codebase
6. ✅ Fixed strcpy_safeafe typos
7. ✅ Fixed class inheritance and forward declaration issues

## Remaining Tasks:
8. ⏳ Create missing header files (in progress)
9. ⏳ Fix undefined references to system components (in progress)

## Summary:
The build process is now much more stable with most of the initial compilation errors resolved. The remaining issues are related to missing header files and unimplemented system components that will require additional development work.

The kernel now compiles through most of the source files without the syntax and type definition errors that were preventing progress earlier.
