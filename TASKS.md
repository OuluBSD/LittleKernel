## Solution Summary for Kernel Reboot Issue:
The kernel rapid reboot issue was caused by timer interrupts firing before interrupt handlers were registered.

## Architecture Notes:

The new kernel should follow these principles:

3. **Performance**: Efficient scheduling and memory management
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
5. **Ultimate++ Integration**: Designed to work well with the Ultimate++ framework

## Logging Standards:

All new code must use the LOG() macro with stream-like syntax for consistency:
- Use: LOG("Message with value " << value << " and more text")
- Do NOT use: GenericWrite() functions directly
- The LOG macro should handle automatic newlines
- For debugging, use DLOG() which adds "[DEBUG]" prefix

## Memory Layout:
- 0x00000000 - 0x000FFFFF: Reserved (NULL pointer detection, interrupt vectors)
- 0x00100000 - 0x0FFFFFFF: Kernel space
- 0x10000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF: User space (per process)
- 0xC0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF: Shared kernel space (page tables, etc.)
